🌿 Plant Disease Detection System

Overview
The Plant Disease Detection System is an AI-powered application that identifies plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It also provides treatment recommendations through a simple Flask web interface, helping farmers and gardeners take early action and reduce crop loss.

Features
- Detects diseases in various plants from leaf images
- Classifies leaves as healthy or diseased
- Provides treatment suggestions for each disease
- User-friendly web interface for easy interaction
- Reduces dependency on experts and saves time
Technology Stack
- Programming Language:Python  
- Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras  
- Web Framework:Flask  
- Frontend:HTML, CSS  
- Dataset:Plant leaf images  
- Tools:Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  
How It Works
1. Upload Image: User uploads a leaf image through the web app.  
2. Preprocessing:The image is resized and normalized for the CNN model.  
3. Prediction:The trained CNN predicts the disease class with confidence.  
4. Results:The system displays disease details and treatment recommendations.
