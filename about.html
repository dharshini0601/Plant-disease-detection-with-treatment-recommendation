    <div class="card shadow-lg p-4">
        <p class="fs-5">
            The <b>Plant Disease Detection System</b> is an intelligent web-based application that helps identify
            plant diseases by analyzing leaf images. The system is designed to assist farmers and agriculture
            students in detecting diseases at an early stage.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-5">
            Users can simply upload an image of a plant leaf, and the system automatically analyzes the image
            using a trained deep learning model. Based on the visual features of the leaf, the system predicts
            whether the plant is healthy or affected by a disease.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-5">
            Along with disease detection, the system also provides basic treatment recommendations.
            This helps users take timely action to prevent further crop damage and improve plant health.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4">🌿 What This System Does</h5>
        <ul class="fs-5">
            <li>Detects plant diseases from leaf images</li>
            <li>Identifies whether the plant is healthy or infected</li>
            <li>Provides disease prediction with confidence</li>
            <li>Suggests basic treatment methods</li>
            <li>Offers a simple and user-friendly interface</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="mt-4">🌱 Why This System Is Useful</h5>
        <p class="fs-5">
            Traditional plant disease identification requires expert knowledge and manual inspection.
            This system reduces dependency on experts and makes disease detection faster, easier,
            and more accessible to everyone.
